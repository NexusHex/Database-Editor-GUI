This is the first iteration of the Database Editor series using Tkinter. I do not intend to remake every single iteration of the Database Editor and will proceed with recreating the latest version of the Database Edtior DecaFunction (https://github.com/NexusHex/Database-Editor-Series/tree/main/Editors/1.6.6%20-%20DecaFunction) after this one.

Date Created: 8/26/2023

Database Editor PentaFunction comes with these features:
>File 'database_store.db' is used to have a database in the program using SQLite3
>
>User can interact with the database through Tkinter widgets, allowing them to **Add values to the database and clear the database**
>
>There is a Tkinter Text widget used to **show the user every item in the database**
>
>The Tkinter Text widget auto-updates to change along with any edits to the data
>
>There is a button to exit the program
